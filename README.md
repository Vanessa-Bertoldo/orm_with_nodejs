# API Project Structured with NodeJS ORM

<p>This repository houses an API project developed using NodeJS, with an emphasis on a structured architecture and the integration of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). The combination of these technologies provides a solid foundation for developing robust and scalable applications.</p>



## Tools ⚒️

<ul>
  <li><b>NodeJS:</b> A server-side JavaScript execution platform that allows you to build scalable web applications.</li>
  <li><b>ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):</b> A tool that simplifies interaction with relational databases by abstracting the database layer and allowing data manipulation using objects in the programming language.</li>
</ul>
